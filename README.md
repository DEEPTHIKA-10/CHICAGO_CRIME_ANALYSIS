# CHICAGO_CRIME_ANALYSIS
# Chicago Crime Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Chicago Crime Analysis** project aims to analyze crime trends in Chicago using historical crime data. The analysis explores various aspects, including crime types, locations, time patterns, and correlations between different factors. The objective is to gain insights that can help law enforcement and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve public safety.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Chicago Police Department Open Data Portal
- **Data Range:** [Specify Date Range]
- **Format:** CSV
- **Attributes:**
  - Crime ID
  - Date & Time
  - Location (Latitude, Longitude)
  - Crime Type (Primary Description)
  - Arrest Status
  - Domestic Crime Indicator
  - Beat, District, Ward, Community Area, ZIP Code

## Analysis Components
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Missing values handling
   - Statistical summary and distribution analysis
   
2. **Crime Trend Analysis**
   - Time-series analysis of crime frequency
   - Crime trends by year, month, and day of the week
   
3. **Geospatial Analysis**
   - Heatmaps of high-crime areas
   - Crime distribution across different districts and neighborhoods
   
4. **Crime Type Analysis**
   - Most common crime categories
   - Violent vs. non-violent crime trends
   
5. **Arrest and Law Enforcement Analysis**
   - Arrest rates by crime type
   - Impact of law enforcement strategies
   
6. **Predictive Modeling (if applicable)**
   - Crime forecasting using machine learning
   - Classification models for crime prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Folium (for mapping)
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau, Plotly
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Geopandas, Folium

## How to Use
1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
2. **Load Dataset:**
   - Place the CSV file in the `data/` directory
   - Use `pandas.read_csv()` to load the data
   
3. **Run Analysis:**
   - Execute `analysis.ipynb` to generate insights and visualizations
   
4. **Visualize Data:**
   - Open `crime_dashboard.ipynb` or use Tableau for interactive charts

## Results & Findings
- [Summarize key findings such as crime hotspots, seasonal trends, most common crimes, etc.]

## Future Work
- Enhance predictive modeling accuracy
- Integrate real-time crime reporting
- Expand analysis to other cities for comparative studies
